## Boundary Value Problems (BVP)

An **Initial Value Problem (IVP)** specifies all conditions at one point:
$$
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \\[3pt]
y(t_0) = y_0
\end{cases}
$$

A **Boundary Value Problem (BVP)** specifies values **at different points**:
$$
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2} = f(t, y, y'), \\[3pt]
y(a) = \alpha, \quad y(b) = \beta
\end{cases}
$$

---

### Intuition

- IVP: “how does the system evolve from a start?”
- BVP: “find a trajectory that satisfies constraints at both ends.”

**Highlight:**  
BVPs arise when both **initial** and **final** states are known, not just the start.

## Applications of BVPs

**Physical and biological systems** often have spatial or steady-state constraints.

| Domain | Example | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Heat conduction | $\dfrac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0$ | Fixed temperatures at the two ends |
| Diffusion in tissues | $D\dfrac{d^2C}{dx^2} - kC = 0$ | Concentrations fixed at boundaries |
| Membrane potential | $\dfrac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}V$ | Voltage specified at both ends |
| Enzyme kinetics in biofilms | Nonlinear diffusion–reaction equations | Concentration and flux constraints |


## Converting 2nd-Order ODE (reminder)

A 2nd-order equation:
$$
\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2} = f(t, y, y')
$$

can be rewritten as a **system**:

$$
\begin{cases}
y_1 = y, \\[3pt]
y_2 = y' = \dfrac{dy_1}{dt}, \\[3pt]
\dfrac{dy_2}{dt} = f(t, y_1, y_2)
\end{cases}
$$

Boundary conditions:
$$
y_1(a) = \alpha, \quad y_1(b) = \beta
$$

Transforming to a first-order system allows reuse of numerical IVP solvers.

## Shooting Method 

Turn a **BVP** into an **IVP** by guessing the missing initial slope.

Example:
$$
\begin{cases}
y'' = f(t, y, y'),\\
y(a) = \alpha, \quad y(b) = \beta
\end{cases}
$$

- Guess $y'(a) = s$  
- Solve the IVP from $a$ to $b$ using $s$  
- Adjust $s$ until $y(b) = \beta$

## Linear vs Nonlinear

### Linear BVP
If the ODE is linear in $y$:
$$
y'' = p(x) y' + q(x) y + r(x)
$$
the relationship between $s$ and $y(b)$ is linear.  
=> Only **one or two IVP integrations** needed.

---

### Nonlinear BVP
If $f$ depends nonlinearly on $y$ or $y'$:
$$
y'' = f(x, y, y')
$$
the mapping is **nonlinear**.  
=> Use a **root-finding method** (e.g. Newton or secant) to correct $s$:
$$
g(s) = y_s(b) - \beta = 0
$$

The nonlinear shooting method combines **IVP integration** + **root finding**.
